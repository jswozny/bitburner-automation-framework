/**
 * Check Factions Action
 *
 * Lightweight one-shot script that checks faction invitations and builds
 * a FactionStatus for the dashboard. Published to port 9 for the faction
 * tool to read.
 *
 * Added to queue runner's round-robin so dashboard gets updates even
 * without the faction daemon running.
 *
 * Target RAM: ~5 GB at SF4.2 (checkFactionInvitations)
